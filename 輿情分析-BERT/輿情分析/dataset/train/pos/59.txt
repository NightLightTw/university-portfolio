The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a test for the virus but the agencys director Robert Redfield said it was not fully reliable. Weve seen people who had a detectable virus then they didnt have a detectable virus and then three days later they had a detectable virus Redfield said. We dont know the natural history of how this virus is secreted. We are going to see additional cases in this country he said. In the six cases we defined a number of them came in asymptomatic. Earlier on Friday the CDC issued a mandatory quarantine order to nearly 200 Americans who were evacuated from China earlier this week. It was the first CDC quarantine in more than 50 years. 摘要：中國衛生官員表示病毒潛伏期為 1~14天，這段時間內即使帶原者無症狀也可 能具有傳染力 (can be infectious)。 CDC 已經有一套檢測病毒的流程，但目前 仍不十分可靠。CDC 局長 Rober Redfiled 表示我們曾發現有患者體內先是可以檢 測到病毒，但後來又檢測不到，然後三天後又再度檢測到病毒。目前我們仍不清楚 病毒是如何把自己隱藏起來的 (We dont know the natural history of how this virus is secreted.) 我們預期美國境內將會出現更多的案例，目前的六個 案例中，有幾個並沒有出現症狀。 週五稍早，CDC 命令近 200名自中國撤離的美國人需接受強制隔離。這是 CDC 超過 50年來首次發佈類似的命令。 ",
